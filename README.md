A BMS app created in flutter using Provider. clone the appropriate branches mentioned below:

* Mobile: https://github.com/dikshyalaya/bms-app.git (master channel)

## Getting Started

The BMS contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or app. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new app. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the apps that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.


## How to Use

**Step 1:**

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```
https://github.com/dikshyalaya/bms-app.git
```

**Step 2:**

Go to app root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

**Step 3:**

This app uses `freezed` library that works with code generation, execute the following command to generate files only if you get some error related to freezed otherwise you are good to go:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

or watch command in order to keep the source code synced automatically:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

## Hide Generated Files (*Optional)

In-order to hide generated files, navigate to `Android Studio` -> `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `File Types` and paste the below lines under `ignore files and folders` section:

```
*.network_exceptions.freezed.dart;*.g.dart;
```

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to `Preferences` -> `Settings` and search for `Files:Exclude`. Add the following patterns:
```
**/*.network_exceptions.freezed.dart
**/*.g.dart (if serializable package is used)
```
